# Cursor Rules Documentation

## Purpose
Cursor Rules provide documentation and guidelines for the AI and developers to follow when working with this codebase. These rules help ensure consistent code organization, style, and project-specific patterns.

## Rule Organization
- Rules are stored in the `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Each rule file uses the `.mdc` extension (Markdown for Cursor)
- Rules should be written in Markdown format with clear headers and structure
- Each rule file should focus on a specific aspect of development

## Rule Naming
- Use descriptive, hyphenated names for rule files
- Examples: `code-organization.mdc`, `style-guide.mdc`, `hardware-integration.mdc`

## Rule Structure
- Start with a clear title (H1)
- Use section headers (H2, H3) to organize content
- Use bullet points for lists of guidelines
- Include examples where helpful
- Keep explanations concise and actionable

## Rule Content Guidelines
- Focus on practical guidance that can be applied to code
- Include rationales for important guidelines
- Group related guidelines under appropriate sections
- Use formatting (bold, lists, etc.) to improve readability
- Avoid overly restrictive rules that limit creativity

## Updating Rules
- Update rules as new patterns emerge in the project
- Ensure new rules align with the existing architecture
- Document new rules after implementing successful patterns
