# NodePhone App Development Guidelines

## App Structure
- Each app should be a Python module in the `src/apps` directory
- Apps must provide a `run()` function as their main entry point
- Apps should be self-contained with minimal dependencies

## App Discovery
- Apps are automatically discovered from the `src/apps` directory
- The AppLauncher loads all modules with a callable `run()` function

## Input/Output Guidelines
- Use `input()` for user input
- Display output with `print()` statements
- Clear the screen at appropriate times with `os.system('clear')`
- Provide a confirmation prompt before returning to the menu
- Use simple ASCII/text-based interfaces

## Error Handling
- Each app should handle its own errors
- Use try/except blocks to catch exceptions
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Always provide a way to return to the main menu
- Never exit the program (let the launcher handle exit)

## App Testing
- Apps should be testable by running them directly (`python src/apps/your_app.py`)
- Include a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that calls the `run()` function
- Ensure apps work both standalone and when launched from the AppLauncher
